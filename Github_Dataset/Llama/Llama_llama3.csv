"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/issues/330","[Question as to why the out projection exists]","2024-09-08T10:32:14Z","Closed issue","No label","Hello! I am curious why the out projection weight in the attention still exists as a separate variable in the Llama implementation.
 By the associative property of matrix multiplication, it makes no difference if the order of computation is 
$(xW_o)FFN_1$ or 
$x(W_o FFN_1)$. However, in the second case, the weights can be combined beforehand, making computation more efficient.
 This applies during training as well, which means that the out-projection weight is redundant.
 Is there a reason why the out-projection weight still exists? I understand that in the original transformer, there was a dropout activation function after the out-projection. However, Llama has long since dropped the dropout, making the out-projection an unnecessary computation.

When trying to run the code using example_chat_completion.py in conjunction with the Llama folder provided by the official website, I only have 2 GPUs available and find that it cannot run. Does this mean that the 70B model, which consists of 8 models, requires 8 GPUs to run, and cannot be run on a machine with only 2 GPUs? How should the code be modified to run with only two GPUs?
Issue 2: The model I downloaded from the Meta official website using the URL provided in download.sh appears to be different from the one on Hugging Face; it is the original model as described by Hugging Face. According to Hugging Face’s explanation: “This repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original Llama codebase.” Therefore, do I need to download the Llama folder and use example_chat_completion.py to run it?

Description:
 I'm encountering several issues while training a model using the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct tokenizer and dataset processing script. The main issues are as follows:
Token ID Out of Range:
 During tokenization, I'm consistently receiving the following warning:
ERROR:__main__:Token ID 128256 out of range, adjusting to 127999

This occurs even after attempting to handle out-of-range token IDs by capping them at the maximum valid token ID (127999). This issue might be affecting the overall model performance and data integrity.
Indexing Assertion Error:
 When generating the training split, the following error is triggered:
/opt/conda/conda-bld/pytorch_1716905969073/work/aten/src/ATen/native/cuda/Indexing.cu:1289: indexSelectLargeIndex: block: [462,0,0], thread: [64,0,0] Assertion `srcIndex < srcSelectDimSize` failed.

This assertion failure suggests that there might be an issue with how indices are being selected during the training process, potentially due to misaligned tensor dimensions or out-of-range indices.
Code:
 Here is the script I'm using for tokenization and dataset processing:

# Your Hugging Face tokenhf_token = '********************************'  # Replace with your actual token

# Specify the model name or pathmodel_name = ""meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct""

# Load the tokenizer without manually setting special tokenstokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, token=hf_token, trust_remote_code=True)

# Example text inputtext = ""What is the capital of France?""

# Tokenize the input texttokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors=""pt"")

# Print the tokenized outputprint(""Tokenized input:"", tokens)

# Decode the tokens back to text (for verification)decoded_text = tokenizer.decode(tokens['input_ids'][0])
print(""Decoded text:"", decoded_text)

# Check for out-of-range token IDsvocab_size = tokenizer.vocab_sizeprint(""Vocabulary Size:"", vocab_size)
for i, token_id in enumerate(tokens[""input_ids""][0]):
    if token_id >= vocab_size:
        print(f""Token ID {token_id} out of range at position {i} (Token: {tokenizer.decode([token_id])})"")
Output:
Tokenized input: {'input_ids': tensor([[128000,   3923,    374,    279,   6864,    315,   9822,     30]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])}
Decoded text: What is the capital of France?
Vocabulary Size: 128000
Token ID 128000 out of range at position 0 (Token: )

Steps to Reproduce:
Use the provided minimal example code to tokenize any input text.
Observe the tokenization process and check the logs for ""Token ID out of range"" errors.
Run the training script with gradient checkpointing enabled.
Monitor for the Indexing.cu assertion error during the generation of the training split.
Environment:
Transformers Version: 4.44.0
CUDA Version: 12.6
PyTorch Version: 2.4.0
Python Version: 3.12.4
OS: TensorML Mumbaforge running on Ubuntu
Hardware Specs: 48 vCPUs, 128 GB RAM, running on Intel Xeon Platinum 8470
Expected Behavior:
 Token IDs should be within the valid range after tokenization. The training process should proceed without assertion errors, and there should be no conflicts between gradient checkpointing and caching.
Additional Context:
 The data being processed includes a mix of unicode and non-unicode characters. The script attempts to clean the data by removing special characters and non-unicode sequences. Despite these precautions, the issues mentioned above persist.
Any guidance on resolving these issues or insights into potential causes would be greatly appreciated.

However, it also says that the parameters were not re-sharded for the backward pass to avoid another all gather reduction. Doesn't this mean that each DP rank needs to have enough memory to hold the entire model's parameters? If so, then why bother sharding parameters for the forward pass if you need enough memory to hold the whole model for the backward pass?

I hope this issue finds you well. My name is Yutong Wu, a PhD student at the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I recently had the opportunity to read the insightful paper of llama3 titled ""The Llama 3 Herd of Models"", and I was impressed by the contribution it makes in synthetic data generation for coding task in 4.3.1.
However, I noticed that our previously work ""InverseCoder: Unleashing the Power of Instruction-Tuned Code LLMs with Inverse-Instruct"" was not cited. Our paper addresses several key aspects that are closely related to the synthetic data generation method used in llama3, and I believe that including a citation to our work would provide a more comprehensive background and acknowledge the contributions made in this domain.
Specifically, our paper also utilizes the idea of backtranslation to expand the SFT dataset for programming task. Our method Inverse-Instruct focuses on the misalignment between translation of formal and informal languages: translating formal language (i.e., code) to informal language(i.e., natural language) is more straightforward than the reverse, while llama3 uses backtranslation to generate code from comments and docstrings. It is interesting to compare the performance difference between the two synthetic directions.
For your reference, here is the complete citation of our paper:

/home/andrew/llama3/llama/generation.py:94: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.

Hello, my friends：
 I have just started learning how to develop large language models and am interning at a small company with only 11 people. I encountered difficulties after downloading the relevant files of llama3 8B. The specific problems are as follows.
 I am trying to test the lamma3 model with a tablet, but my graphics card is an Intel integrated graphics card and cannot use Intel Arc (it requires independent graphics card support). After debugging the paths of tokenizer_model and checkpoint, each run shows that the cuda driver needs to be used, but the Intel graphics card does not support the use of any version of cuda.

I tried to use the torch.distributed.fsdp.FullyShardedDataParallel to wrap my model which uses llama3-70b as the text generator. However, I found it does work. The code is like that:
llama_model = my_llama.build(
                ckpt_dir = ckpt_dir,
                tokenizer_path =tokenizer_path,
                max_seq_len = max_seq_len,
                max_batch_size = max_batch_size,
                model_parallel_size = model_parallel_size) 
    
self.llama_model = FSDP(llama_model)

And I also use torch.utils.data.distributed.DistributedSampler to build the sampler in dataloader:
self.train_sampler = DistributedSampler(train_dataset, shuffle=True)
self.train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_dataset, 
                                           batch_size=batch_size, 
                                           #generator=torch.Generator(device='cuda'),
                                           num_workers=1, 
                                           pin_memory=True,
                                           shuffle=(self.train_sampler is None),
                                           sampler=self.train_sampler,
                                           )

And I got error:
[rank1]:[E ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:563] [Rank 1] Watchdog caught collective operation timeout: WorkNCCL(SeqNum=1, OpType=ALLREDUCE, NumelIn=704512, NumelOut=704512, Timeout(ms)=600000) ran for 600013 milliseconds before timing out.
[rank0]:[E ProcessGroupNCCL.cpp:563] 

My other codes should be correct and they work well when I do not use FSDP. The reason why I try to use FSDP is because I found the 8 ranks seems return the same loss and result; I record the result and loss in wandb and found the 8 devices have the same output. Hence I tried to implement the data parallel to utilize the 8 GPUs.
Can you tell me how to run llama3-70b with FSDP or DDP?

Hello dear Meta AI.
 There has been a typo in your Hugging Face repositories containing Llama-3 models.
The link to the HuggingFace Hub collections is the following:
https://huggingface.co/collections/meta-llama/meta-llama-3-66214712577ca38149ebb2b6

And the bug occurs when ones tries to click the url from the Citation instructions section on Hub.
BibTex is the following:
@article{llama3modelcard,
title={Llama 3 Model Card},
author={AI@Meta},
year={2024},
url = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md}
}
, but should be corrected the link, because, as of now, it redirects to the
llama3/MODEL_CARD.md}

, instead of the
llama3/MODEL_CARD.md

Possible solution
I guess you should move the closing parenthesis } on HuggingFace hub to the next line.

Just as an example, lets see the token_ids for the words ""are"" and ""ARE"". If the hypothesis is true that more frequent tokens have lower token_id, then we would expect ""are"" to have a lower token_id that ""ARE"". And indeed that is the case:
>>> from transformers import AutoTokenizer>>> tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct')

>>> tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids('are')
548

>>> tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids('ARE')
4577
I am trying to implement something which requires me to know the occurrence rank of tokens. If I know the answer to the above question, I might use token_id as a proxy for inverse rank.

This is probably a consequence of the how regex splits, and thus in some sense not a bug...but it is somewhat unfortunate. The sequence \t\t} exhibits the same behavior, and is very common in Go code, so there are lots of missed merges.

According to the reference, Taylor Swift signed with Sony/ATV Tree publishing house in 2004 at age 14, and her contract with Big Machine Records in 2005 enabled her to work on the album during her second year of high school. Therefore, when her debut album was released in 2006, she was 15 years old.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I apologize for the mistake. According to the reference, Taylor Swift signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, which enabled her to work on the album during her second year of high school. Since her debut album was released in 2006, she was 16 years old when it was released.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

I was wrong again! Thank you for correcting me. According to the reference, Taylor Swift's debut album was released in 2006, and she signed with Big Machine Records in 2005, which enabled her to work on the album during her second year

The essential question is: what decide the model's max context length to 8K? IF my understanding is correct, I can increase the max context length as long as I have enough GPU memory and computation resources (and maybe time) right?
 Or is the 8K length related with the training data of the model?(i.e. the max length of the training data is up to 8K)
If I increase the max context length to 16K from 8K, by only changing the model's initialization argument, should I do a further finetune for the model with longer data sequence?
 Will there be a performance degradation(except inference speed)if I do not apply any further finetune after increasing the max context length.
Thanks!

"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/issues/218","How Does LLaMA3 Merge Multiple Short Texts During the Pretraining Process?","2024-06-22T21:26:10Z","Closed issue","question","LLaMA3 supports an 8K token context length. When continuously pretraining with proprietary data, the majority of the text data is significantly shorter than 8K tokens, resulting in a substantial amount of padding. To enhance training efficiency and effectiveness, it is necessary to merge multiple short texts into a longer text, with the length remaining below 8K tokens. However, the question arises: how should these short texts be combined into a single training sequence? Should they be separated by delimiters, or should an approach involving masking be used during the pretraining process?
 Regarding the use of delimiters, as seen in GPT2 during its pretraining phase, multiple short texts were combined into a longer text using the [SEP] token. However, LLaMA3’s tokenizer does not define a [SEP] token or a similar one. It includes two stop tokens: <|end_of_text|> and <|eot_id|>, where the former acts like an EOS token, and the latter serves as an end token for each turn in a dialogue. Should<|end_of_text|> or <|eot_id|> be used as the delimiter during training, or should a new delimiter be custom-defined?
 As for the masking approach, it is inspired by a method described in the LLaMA3 official blog, which states, ""We trained the models on sequences of 8,192 tokens using a mask to ensure self-attention does not cross document boundaries."" Does this imply that LLaMA3 does not use explicitly defined short text delimiters to merge multiple texts, but instead combines them using <|end_of_text|> and <|end_of_text|>, then masks other short texts during the pretraining to facilitate model training?

"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/issues/203","The absence or presence of a system token results in different outputs.","2024-05-29T17:47:12Z","Closed issue","bug","Describe the bug
As per the official documentation:
https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/meta-llama-3/
It is stated:
A prompt should contain a single system message, can contain multiple alternating user and assistant messages, and always ends with the last user message followed by the assistant header.
However, in follow-up examples given in the documentation, system token is only present if the system message is present:
1: Single message example
<|begin_of_text|>1<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>2
{{ user_message }}3<|eot_id|>4<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>5

2: System prompt message added to a single user message
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
{{ system_prompt }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
{{ user_message }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

However, having no system message string present but still include the system token, results in a completely different output compared to having no system token at all.
This can be seen here in my findings:
ggerganov/llama.cpp#7062 (comment)
Fine tuning instruct model:
 Fine tuning the instruct models with system token present, and then run inference without system tokens present, breaks the fine tuning.
Inference on original instruct model:
 Since the outputs are different based on the presence of system tokens, the question arrives, is the output better or worse for the instruct models? Which method produces the expected output based on the instruct tuning that has been done internally by Meta?

The weight files (*.safetensors) and some additional files (README.md and LICENSE) download successfully, but the other files (e.g., all of the *.json files) raise an HTTP 401 Unauthorized error.
I can view the problematic files on the HuggingFace website without issue.

I am not really sure what's going on and I would like to obtain more information regarding my options to get access as I am really eager to start experimenting with the model : )
I am really sorry for reaching out by creating an issue within the github repo but I tried connecting with people on HF via creation of this HF discussion and commenting on this discussion and this other discussion without any luck.

If you give the model a 4 digit numeric string like ""8888"", it will always change it to ""88,888"".
If you change your input to ""7,777 + 3,333"" the model consistently gives the correct answer.

I'm not looking for the model to do simple math, I'm looking for the model to not fuzz my input.
Trying What is 7777 + 3333? and both models keep changing my input to ""77,777 + 33,333"".
Both models will often give the correct answer to 77,777 + 33,333, however that's not what was asked.

 I submit the Llama-3 models access in Hugging face prior to submit access in Meta. This is my mistake, I got Meta email on approval but maybe is too late and have a while after I submit to HF. It have passed several days, HF is still pending as below screenshot. is there a way to gain access on HF? or cancel my access application of LLama3 in HF that I can re-submit?

"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/issues/155","Getting attention weights for generated text from llama3-8b-instruct","2024-04-26T14:27:56Z","Open issue","No label","Hello,
I'm trying to visualize the attention weights for Llama 3 when it generates text, but I am facing some complications. I slightly modified the Attention class to output the scores variable (which I am guessing is the attention weights, since it is multiplied to produce the attention outputs), and then I save the attention weight values in the TransformerBlock class as an attribute. I also modified this step in the forward function h = x + self.attention(self.attention_norm(x), start_pos, freqs_cis, mask) to
y, self.weights = self.attention(self.attention_norm(x), start_pos, freqs_cis, mask)
h = x + y

where self.weights is attention weights.
Now, in generation.py, in generate function, starting from line 175, I modify the for loop in this way:
attention_dict = dict()
for cur_pos in range(min_prompt_len, total_len):
        logits = self.model.forward(tokens[:, prev_pos:cur_pos], prev_pos)
        # taking the last transformer block
        attention_dict[cur_pos] = self.model.layers[-1].weights.float().cpu().numpy()

        if temperature > 0:
            probs = torch.softmax(logits[:, -1] / temperature, dim=-1)
            next_token = sample_top_p(probs, top_p)
        else:
            next_token = torch.argmax(logits[:, -1], dim=-1)

        next_token = next_token.reshape(-1)
        # only replace token if prompt has already been generated
        next_token = torch.where(
            input_text_mask[:, cur_pos], tokens[:, cur_pos], next_token
        )
        tokens[:, cur_pos] = next_token
        if logprobs:
            token_logprobs[:, prev_pos + 1 : cur_pos + 1] = -F.cross_entropy(
                input=logits.transpose(1, 2),
                target=tokens[:, prev_pos + 1 : cur_pos + 1],
                reduction=""none"",
                ignore_index=pad_id,
            )
        eos_reached |= (~input_text_mask[:, cur_pos]) & (
            torch.isin(next_token, stop_tokens)
        )
        prev_pos = cur_pos
        if all(eos_reached):
            break

The idea is to get the attention weights from the last transformer block for each step of token generation, so that I can go back to any generated token and see how the attention weights are distributed along the generated sequence length.
However, the problem that I am facing is, that there are 32 heads for Llama3. If I average across all 32 heads to reduce dimensionality for visualization purposes, and then apply Softmax to the output, the attention weights that I am getting for any step of generation has the exact same distribution, with the first few tokens, and the last two tokens having a much higher value, while every other token has the exact same weight (which is very miniscule). I have also tried max pooling across heads instead of averaging, but it yielded similar results.
My point is that this doesn't seem right, because it also remains the same across different prompts, which means there is something wrong with my approach. Could you please guide me in the right direction?
Thanks!

System Info
 transformers version : '4.39.2'
Who can help?
 we used our existing fine-tune code, which worked with llama1 and llama2 base models
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    args=training_args,
    **data_module,
    callbacks=[ManifoldTensorBoardLoggerCallback()],
)
trainer.train()

but once the trainer starts fine-tuning from a llama3-8B, it barely makes any progress (""only prints the 0% on the progress status once, and then never updates it) after 5 hours. previously with llama2-7B, it runs through 40% of our examples within 25 minutes
I see that it's the same code as recommended by wiki

Any idea why ? LLaMA-2 LlamaTokenizer works just fine.
Thanks in advanced.

I'm attempting to port the chat example and I get errors about initializing torch.distributed. (RANK not defined, MASTER_ADDR not defined, etc.) I tried following the manual nccl steps outlined here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56805951/valueerror-error-initializing-torch-distributed-using-env-rendezvous-enviro but I just get a loop with failing to connect.
It looks like the start of Llama.build() is where things are erroring out.
if not torch.distributed.is_initialized():
     torch.distributed.init_process_group(""nccl"")
I'll be going through the nccl debug process and will eventually switch to Linux if needed but first my questions.
Are there any plans to have an option of bypassing the need for torch.distributed?
Is there a way to load the pre-trained model for inference without torch.distributed?
Has anyone been successful interacting with a local model from a notebook?

"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/issues/126","A big question: should I re-pretrain after extending vocab with LLaMA-3 pretrained weight or finetuned weight ?","2024-04-23T04:56:02Z","Open issue","No label","A big question: should I re-pretrain after extending vocab with LLaMA-3 pretrained weight or finetuned weight ? It took forever and costly to pretrain, hence I would be eager to know if we should re-pretrain the LLaMA-3 pretrained weights after extending its vocab as of this https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/issues or should we re-pretrain directly the beautifully finetuned LLaMA-3 weights and then finetune further ? Would the latent space of LLaMA-3 finetuned weight be bias towards its finetune too much ?
Just want to retain as much finetuned weight of LLaMA-3 as possible because of the quality of it.
Thanks in advanced Meta team.

 The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is not the same type as the class this function is called from. It may result in unexpected tokenization.
 The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is 'PreTrainedTokenizerFast'.
 The class this function is called from is 'LlamaTokenizer'.
 You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the legacy (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set legacy=False. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in huggingface/transformers#24565

"https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/issues/104","Llama3 chat template and eos_token","2024-04-21T18:48:33Z","Open issue","No label","The chat template, bos_token and eos_token defined for llama3 instruct in the tokenizer_config.json is as follows:
 chat template:
 {% set loop_messages = messages %}{% for message in loop_messages %}{% set content = '<|start_header_id|>' + message['role'] + '<|end_header_id|>\n\n'+ message['content'] | trim + '<|eot_id|>' %}{% if loop.index0 == 0 %}{% set content = bos_token + content %}{% endif %}{{ content }}{% endfor %}{{ '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n' }}
bos_token: ""<|begin_of_text|>""
 eos_token : ""<|end_of_text|>""
If in every turn the content is ending with token ""<|eot_id|>"" even for multi-turn conversations then it looks like this:
<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>
{{ system_prompt }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
{{ user_message_1 }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
{{ model_answer_1 }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
{{ user_message_2 }}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
Then while finetuning shouldn't the model supposed to be learning to predict the 'eos_token' in the end of its response instead of <|eot_id|>?
 Which means shouldn't the chat template supposed to be like this:
 {% set loop_messages = messages %}{% for message in loop_messages %}{% set content = '<|start_header_id|>' + message['role'] + '<|end_header_id|>\n\n'+ message['content'] | trim + eos_token %}{% if loop.index0 == 0 %}{% set content = bos_token + content %}{% endif %}{{ content }}{% endfor %}{{ '<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n' }}
Note: Replaced '<|eot_id|>' with eos_token variable which will replace it with the actual eos_token defined in the tokenizer_config.json

Problem Description:
 After successfully downloading a large dataset (specifically, the 70B model) from the Meta Llama website, an error occurred during the checksum verification process.
Steps Taken:
Download Process: The download process was initiated following the provided instructions from the llama3 GitHub installation documentation
File Retrieval: All files, including the model weights and tokenizer, were successfully downloaded from the provided URL (after request from the official form of Meta).
Error Encounter: Upon completion of the download process, an error was encountered during the checksum verification step.
Error Details: The error message displayed was:
Connecting to download6.llamameta.net (download6.llamameta.net)|108.157.60.6|:443... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable
The file is already fully retrieved; nothing to do.
Checking checksums
md5sum: checklist.chk: no properly formatted MD5 checksum lines found

Troubleshooting Attempts:
 Verification of URL: The provided URL was verified to ensure correctness.
 Retry Attempts: The download process was retried, but the error persisted.
 Review of Documentation: The documentation and instructions provided by Meta Llama were reviewed for any potential errors or omissions.
Issue Persistence: Despite multiple attempts and verification steps, the error could not be resolved.
Bug Suspicions: The possibility of a bug or technical issue during the installation process is suspected. There may be a problem with installing md5sum or wget (especially md5sum).
Conclusion:
 Despite diligent efforts and adherence to provided instructions, the encountered error during the checksum verification process remains unresolved.

The 8B model is quoted as requiring 1.3M GPU hours of compute, for example, which seems like a lot, but given that your training clusters each have 24K GPUs (24576, to be precise), that would seem to indicate that only 53 hours of pre-training would be needed if utilising an entire cluster (1300000 / 24576).
What am I failing to understand here please, or is that actually correct?
BTW, thank you so much for gifting us this amazing piece of technology 🙏

I notice that there are 250 ""reserved special tokens"" defined in the tokenizer. Is there any information available on what these are meant for, and what users are supposed to (not) do with them? For instance, could one use some of these tokens in finetunes (instead of adding additional tokens and resizing the vocabulary), or would that be problematic?
Thanks so much!

It appears that macOS does not support the NCCL backend used by default in many PyTorch distributed processes, and I have been unable to find a way to configure the system to use the gloo backend for local operations on macOS.
Any guidance on how to resolve this issue or recommendations for running Llama 3 on a MacBook would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!

Your prompt:write python function to calculate nth fibbonacci number

==================================

Role:assistant
Content:Here is a simple Python function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
```
This function uses a recursive approach to calculate the Fibonacci number. It works by calling itself with smaller values of `n` until it reaches the base case of `n <= 1`, at which point it returns the value of `n`.

However, this function has a time complexity of O(2^n), which means it becomes very slow for large values of `n`. A more efficient approach is to use an iterative approach, like this:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    a, b = 0, 1
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    return b
```
This function uses a loop to iterate from 2 to `n`, and at each iteration, it updates the values of `a` and `b` to be the next two Fibonacci numbers. The final value of `b` is the `n`-th Fibonacci number.

You can test these functions with a value of `n`, like this:
```
print(fibonacci(10))  # prints 55
```
Note that the iterative approach is much faster than the recursive approach for large values of `n`.

Your prompt:use dynamic programming

==================================

Role:assistant
Content:Here is a Python function that uses dynamic programming to calculate the nth Fibonacci number:
```
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n

    fib_values = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib_values[0] = 0
    fib_values[1] = 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib_values[i] = fib_values[i-1] + fib_values[i-2]

    return fib_values[n]
```
This function uses a list `fib_values` to store the Fibonacci numbers as they are calculated. The list is initialized with `n+1` elements, all set to 0.

The function then iterates from 2 to `n`, and at each iteration, it calculates the `i`-th Fibonacci number by adding the `(i-1

 I'd like to Inference this great model.
 I was performing the contents of the README.md file accordingly.
 However, there was an error during execution, so I'm inquiring about the issue.
There was no problem doing the following.
In a conda env with PyTorch / CUDA available clone and download this repository.
In the top-level directory run: $ pip install -e .
Visit the Meta Llama website and register to download the model/s.
Once registered, you will get an email with a URL to download the models. You will need this URL when you run the download.sh script.
Once you get the email, navigate to your downloaded llama repository and run the download.sh script.
Make sure to grant execution permissions to the download.sh script
 During this process, you will be prompted to enter the URL from the email.
 Do not use the “Copy Link” option but rather make sure to manually copy the link from the email.
However, if you run the contents below, an error occurs.
 6. Once the model/s you want have been downloaded, you can run the model locally using the command below:
torchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_chat_completion.py \
    --ckpt_dir Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/ \
    --tokenizer_path Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct/tokenizer.model \
    --max_seq_len 512 --max_batch_size 6

If I execute the above command, the following error is output.

In my opinion, the cause of the problem is that the NVIDIA driver is old and not compatible with the current CUDA version. Also, it is presumed to be a problem that the NCCL backend is not available because the GPU is not detected.
 I would greatly appreciate it if you could let me know the NVIDIA driver specifications and the version of CUDA you recommend in relation to it.
 My current my Python version is 3.8.0, CUDA version is 11.7, and my GPU is using RTX 2080 TI 12GB x 2 devices.

帮我算一个鸡兔同笼问题，笼子里放的是鸡和兔子，一共一百只脚，请问一共有几只兔子，几只鸡





LLama 3: 8b-instruct-q4
···
 🐓 Let's solve this classic puzzle! 🐰
Since there are 100 feet in total, and each bird (chicken or rabbit) has two feet, we can divide the total number of feet by 2 to get the total number of birds.
100 feet ÷ 2 = 50 birds
Now, let's use the fact that the ratio of rabbits to chickens is 2:5. This means that for every 2 rabbits, there are 5 chickens. Let's call the number of rabbits x. Then, the number of chickens is (5/2)x.
We know that the total number of birds is 50, so we can set up an equation:
x + (5/2)x = 50
Combine like terms:
3x/2 = 50
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
3x = 100
Divide both sides by 3:
x = 33.33 (round down to 33, since we can't have a fraction of a rabbit!)
Now that we know there are 33 rabbits, we can find the number of chickens:
Number of chickens = (5/2)x
 = (5/2)(33)
 = 83.33 (round down to 83)
So, there are 33 rabbits and 83 chickens in the coop! 🐓🐰

鸡兔同笼问题是一个经典的数学问题，可以通过设立方程来解决。我们知道鸡有2只脚，兔子有4只脚。如果我们设鸡的数量为 
𝑥
x，兔子的数量为 
𝑦
y，根据题目条件，我们可以列出以下两个方程：

鸡和兔子的总数：
𝑥
+
𝑦
=
10
x+y=10（假设一共有10只动物）
鸡和兔子的脚的总数：
2
𝑥
+
4
𝑦
=
100
2x+4y=100
接下来解这个方程组：

从第一个方程中，我们可以得到 
𝑥
=
10
−
𝑦
x=10−y。

将 
𝑥
=
10
−
𝑦
x=10−y 代入第二个方程中：

2
(
10
−
𝑦
)
+
4
𝑦
=
100
2(10−y)+4y=100

展开得到：

20
−
2
𝑦
+
4
𝑦
=
100
20−2y+4y=100

合并同类项：

2
𝑦
=
100
−
20
2y=100−20

2
𝑦
=
80
2y=80

然后除以2得到兔子的数量：

𝑦
=
40
y=40

现在我们知道兔子有40只，我们可以计算鸡的数量：

𝑥
=
10
−
𝑦
=
10
−
40
=
−
30
x=10−y=10−40=−30

但是动物的数量不能是负数，这意味着我们在方程的设置上犯了一个错误。我们重新审视问题，发现问题中只提到了“一共一百只脚”，而并没有提到动物的总数。因此，我们应该只使用脚的总数来设立方程。

设兔子的数量为 
𝑥
x，鸡的数量为 
𝑦
y，我们有：

4
𝑥
+
2
𝑦
=
100
4x+2y=100

由于鸡和兔子的脚总数为100，我们可以尝试不同的 
𝑥
x 和 
𝑦
y 的值来找到可能的解。我们知道兔子的脚数是鸡的两倍，所以可以通过尝试不同的 
𝑥
x 值（兔子的数量）来找到对应的 
𝑦
y 值（鸡的数量）。

例如，如果兔子有20只（
𝑥
=
20
x=20），则兔子的脚数为 
20
×
4
=
80
20×4=80，鸡的脚数为 
100
−
80
=
20
100−80=20，所以鸡的数量 
𝑦
=
20
/
2
=
10
y=20/2=10。

因此，一个可能的解是：有10只鸡和20只兔子。由于问题中没有提到动物的总数，可能有多个解。但是，如果我们假设动物总数最少（即最符合“一共一百只脚”的条件），那么上述解就是正确的。

The doubao AI
通常情况下，每只鸡有 2 只脚，每只兔子有 4 只脚。
设兔子的数量为 x，鸡的数量为 y。
因为一共 100 只脚，可得到方程：4x + 2y = 100。
由于没有给出鸡和兔子的总数，所以无法确定具体有几只兔子和几只鸡。
鸡兔同笼问题可能有多种情况，需要更多的条件才能得出具体的答案。
如果你能提供更多的信息，我可以帮你进一步计算。

 It seems LLama3 is using “right” padding and using “eos_token“ as the “padding_token”. Could you help verify that if I want to train this model, what should be the padding side and padding token? because it is different than many other LLMs, like Gemma is using “left” padding and has a dedicated padding_token, so does many other models. So here i just want to double check and make sure I'm doing the correct config when training/fine-tuning Llama3.
