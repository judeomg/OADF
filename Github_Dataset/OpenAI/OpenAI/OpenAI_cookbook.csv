People around the web are building beautiful applications on OpenAI SDK and vast majority of them are RAG-based. This cookbook can help developers achieve better results.
I would like to contribute a simple solution of keeping track of sources when LLM accesses vector store and then streaming back the right reference with the relevant chunk to front end. I would then show how the references can be rendered on a demo front end.

examples/data/hotel_invoices/extracted_invoice_json 
Describe the problem
 When attempting to clone the repository, the process fails due to an invalid file path. Specifically, the file examples/data/hotel_invoices/extracted_invoice_json /20190119_002_extracted.json contains an extra space between extracted_invoice_json and the filename. This causes the following error during the checkout of the working tree:
error: invalid path 'examples/data/hotel_invoices/extracted_invoice_json /20190119_002_extracted.json'
fatal: unable to checkout working tree
warning: Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.

Upon inspection, it appears that this path is an unnecessary duplicate of the valid folder examples/data/hotel_invoices/extracted_invoice_json/, which already exists without the space.
Describe a solution
 The issue can be resolved by removing the folder with the invalid path (examples/data/hotel_invoices/extracted_invoice_json /) from the repository. This will prevent the path conflict and allow users to clone the repository without issues.
Additional context
 This error commonly occurs on operating systems that enforce strict path constraints, such as Windows, which I am using.

Description:
Our team is encountering an issue when attempting to access a department mailbox (e.g., IT or HR) using Microsoft Graph API with OpenAI Actions GPT integration outlook cookbook example. Initially, this use-case is functional. However, after a day or so, we’re encountering a problem when attempting to read the messages from this account using the custom GPT. The GPT decides to use credentials from our personal accounts instead of the department credentials for the mailbox configured in the custom GPT.
We have configured the necessary Azure application and permissions to access the department's mailbox, but the following error is returned:
{
  ""error"": {
    ""code"": ""MailboxNotEnabledForRESTAPI"",
    ""message"": ""The mailbox is either inactive, soft-deleted, or is hosted on-premise.""
  }
}

GPT message :
 """"""
It appears my configuration is currently linked personal@example.com. To read emails from department@example.com, the mailbox connection would need to be updated to that specific account. Please ensure I am connected to the right mailbox or adjust any necessary settings on your end for access.
Let me know if you'd like further assistance!
""""""
Even after signing out, asking to re-authenticate, this issue persists.
Furthermore, when asking for the full API request, the GPT indicates that it is trying to read from the user's personal mailbox instead of the department's mailbox.
Steps to Reproduce:
Configure an Azure application to access a shared department mailbox (e.g., IT or HR) using OAuth authentication, specifically the outlook cookbook example .
Attempt to retrieve unread emails via the /me/messages endpoint using Microsoft Graph API. This should be succesfull. After a day or so, the custom GPT will most likely try to authenticate using your personal account instead of the configured department account/email address.
The API returns the error mentioned above.
Expected Behavior:
The shared department mailbox should be accessible, allowing our team to retrieve emails on behalf of that mailbox without needing to authenticate with personal accounts, even after multiple days of inactivity.
Actual Behavior:
The API responds with an error that indicates the mailbox is inactive, on-prem or not supported by the API.
Context:
Our goal is to automate the management of a shared department mailbox (such as IT or HR) rather than using personal accounts. While we have successfully set up permissions for the department mailbox, the system currently seems to authenticate only with personal accounts days after creating the GPT with Actions, which is not the intended use case.
We prefer to restrict OAuth authentication specifically to the department account, rather than relying on personal credentials or account flexibility. The department mailbox is active and accessible via Outlook, correctly configured in the custom gpt with actions, but the API throws this error, suggesting a mismatch in configuration.
Proposed Solution:
We would appreciate guidance on how to ensure that the Graph API exclusively authenticates with the department account and bypasses personal account authentication.

 When using mixed RTL languages (e.g., Persian/Arabic) and LTR languages (e.g., English), text directionality becomes problematic. Sentences that begin with LTR text cause the entire sentence, including RTL portions, to be left-aligned, disrupting structure and readability. This affects the user experience, making it difficult for those writing in RTL languages to have correctly aligned text.
Steps to Reproduce:
 Start a sentence with English text.
 Continue the sentence with Persian/Arabic text.
 Notice the misalignment of RTL text within the sentence.
Expected Behavior:
 Text should respect its natural directionality. If a sentence starts in RTL, the alignment should default to right-aligned, ensuring consistency throughout.
Suggestion:
 Implement automatic detection for RTL and LTR languages and adjust text direction accordingly.

 openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/gpt4o/introduction_to_gpt4o.ipynb
Describe the problem
 In the cookbook, it is stated that the new 4o mini that the model is able to accept inputs of text and image. However when using the code provided in openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/gpt4o/introduction_to_gpt4o.ipynb, section Base64 Image Processing, the AI simply returns responses similar to ""I am unable to view the image..."".
Additional context
 By changing the model to GPT 4o and nothing else (changing the model=""gpt-4o-mini"" to model = gpt-4o""), the desired response is achieved. Either there is an issue with GPT 4o mini API, or the cookbook has mistakenly labeled it as being able to support image inputs.

 The problem is here:

If key=='weight', you should not call encode(value), because value should be numeric.
 (You may want to check that value is numeric and indeed that value in [0,1], which is all that is supported now, at least according to OpenAI's documentation.)

Describe the problem
 The current tiktoken sample implementation does not include the latest models released since gpt-4-turbo. These models, such as gpt-4o, gpt-4o-2024-05-13, and gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09, have different token pricing and context limits that need to be accounted for.

 Update the tiktoken sample implementation to include the latest models:
gpt-4o

I appreciate how you didn’t edit or cherry-pick the results from Example 2. Because that’s what we see in the wild.
What are some approaches to prevent or deal with the hallucinations shown in Example 2: Question and Answering?
Do we just build the workflows and wait for the models to get better in the future?
Do we somehow post-process the response e.g. use other LLMs to validate, always keep human in the loop, etc?
A cookbook example of these methods would be very valuable.

A simple solution would be to adjust the cookbook (which, I assume, is outdated) to reflect the newly added functionality described in the documentation. Or vice-versa.

Describe a solution
 GPT sayeth:
The issue appears to be that the row embeddings are not of the expected shape. Specifically, they are being interpreted as (1,) instead of the expected shape matching the query embedding (1536,). This suggests that the embeddings may be nested within another structure or not correctly formatted.
To address this, we should ensure that each embedding is correctly extracted and reshaped. Here's the updated code to handle this:
import pandas as pdimport numpy as npfrom scipy import spatial

def strings_ranked_by_relatedness(
    query: str,

# Assuming `client` and `EMBEDDING_MODEL` are defined elsewhere in your code
In this updated code:
The process_embedding function now checks that each embedding is not only non-empty but also 1-D and has the same length as the query embedding.
If an embedding fails these checks, it is skipped, and a message is printed indicating why it was skipped.
This should handle cases where the embeddings have unexpected shapes and ensure that only valid embeddings are processed.

 As an active developer and user of ChatGPT, I often find it challenging to find high-quality prompts. While there are various sources available, they tend to be scattered and inconsistent in quality. This fragmentation can be frustrating for users who need reliable and diverse prompts for various use cases.
Describe the solution you'd like
 I propose adding my library of ChatGPT prompts to the OpenAI list of resources. This library currently contains over 600 high-quality prompts, with new prompts being added daily. I also take requests from users to create custom prompts, ensuring the library remains relevant and tailored to the needs of the community. The library is available for free, making it accessible to a wide audience and serving as a valuable resource for anyone using ChatGPT.
Additional context
 Including this library in the OpenAI resources would provide users with a centralized, reliable source of high-quality prompts, enhancing their experience and enabling more effective use of ChatGPT.
Link to the library: https://promptadvance.club/chatgpt-prompts

 average_distance = calculate_average_distance(responses)
 print(f""The average similarity between responses is: {average_distance}"")

 utils?
Describe the problem
 I tried to replicate the reproducable-outputs-with-seed-parameter guide: https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/reproducible_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter.
When importing
import asyncio
from IPython.display import display, HTML

from utils.embeddings_utils import (
    get_embedding,
    distances_from_embeddings
)

I get this error: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'
I Updated to openai=1.3.3 but still got the error.
I assume the utils library is something imported by openai?
Thanks for your help.

I’m not saying the provided code doesn’t work, just that the example response apparently is no longer correct, perhaps because the Chinook schema was changed recently?
I learned this when debugging my code based on the example. It wasn’t working so as a sanity test I copied the sample query and ran it against the database, thus uncovering the problem.

 With curiosity about functionalities of GPT Store, I tried to find a way to publish my application to GPT Store just like Google Play.
 But I couldn't. All instructions to create custom GPT is to use OpenAI's platform.
 I want to know the solution if any.
 If not, this solution will be great hit to the world since lots of developers have already developed their own GPT and they want to share their works with others.

The issue I am facing right now is that when printing a thread, it will print everything in it.
 Every time a new run takes place, showing the conversation requires that you print the complete thread once more..... looks redundant and disorganized.
There does not seem to be a way to only print the outcome (new messages added) per run.
 The only way to do this is to create code that tracks the messages and only print out the newly added messages to the thread.
 Any easier way of achieving this?
 Thanks.

 N/A - This issue is related to the OpenAI API's deterministic behavior when using the seed parameter.
Describe the problem
 I am encountering an issue where I receive inconsistent outputs from the OpenAI API despite setting the same seed parameter for deterministic behavior. This is unexpected as the seed parameter is intended to ensure reproducibility of results. Both the System Fingerprint and the Seed values are identical for different requests, but the responses differ.
Describe a solution
 A potential solution would be to investigate the determinism functionality within the OpenAI API when the seed parameter is set. Ensuring that the outputs are consistent across multiple requests with the same seed would resolve this issue.
Screenshots

Additional context
The code is being run using the following notebook: https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Deterministic_outputs_with_the_seed_parameter.ipynb
The issue persists across multiple attempts and different times, suggesting it is not an intermittent issue.

 The embeddings_utils.py file has not been updated to API V1 which causes a number of errors:
Uses a* methods such as acreate
Doesn't use new names, e.g. openai.Embedding.create() -> client.embeddings.create()

"https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/issues/812","[PROBLEM] Python scripts to validate data & estimate costs fail when fine-tuning with function calling","2023-12-21T22:20:48Z","Closed as not planned issue","bug","Describe the problem
The Python scripts provided in the cookbook to validate data and estimate costs fail when we try to fine-tune a model with function calling. OpenAI recommends the following format when fine-tuning a model with function calling:
{
    ""messages"": [
        {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""What is the weather in San Francisco?""},
        {""role"": ""assistant"", ""function_call"": {""name"": ""get_current_weather"", ""arguments"": ""{\""location\"": \""San Francisco, USA\"", \""format\"": \""celcius\""}""}
    ],
    ""functions"": [{
        ""name"": ""get_current_weather"",
        ""description"": ""Get the current weather"",
        ""parameters"": {
            ""type"": ""object"",
            ""properties"": {
                ""location"": {""type"": ""string"", ""description"": ""The city and country, eg. San Francisco, USA""},
                ""format"": {""type"": ""string"", ""enum"": [""celsius"", ""fahrenheit""]}
            },
            ""required"": [""location"", ""format""]
        }
    }]
}

However, this format does not pass the python scripts provided by the cookbook.
For example, here's a line of my JSONL that fails:
{""messages"":[{""role"":""user"",""content"":""\""I love playing soccer\""""},{""role"":""assistant"",""function_call"":{""name"":""isProfane"",""arguments"":""{\""phrase\"":\""I love playing soccer\""}""}},{""role"":""function"",""name"":""isProfane"",""content"":""false""},{""role"":""assistant"",""content"":""false""}],""functions"":[{""name"":""isProfane"",""description"":""Check the string for profanity"",""parameters"":{""type"":""object"",""properties"":{""phrase"":{""type"":""string"",""description"":""The string to check for profanity""}},""required"":[""phrase""]}}]}

This fails in at least three places in the scripts:
message_missing_key & missing_content errors on every line because not every message will have a content key
 ex:
 {
      role: 'assistant',
      function_call: {
        name: 'isProfane',
        arguments: JSON.stringify({ ""phrase"": phrase }),
      },
    },

encoding error when doing num_tokens += len(encoding.encode(value)) because ""key, value"" are not always able to be encoded. for example:
role assistant //success
function_call {'name': 'isProfane', 'arguments': '{""phrase"":""darn I hate that game""}'} //failure

same encoding error as above on this line:
  num_tokens += len(encoding.encode(message[""content""]))

Describe a solution
Fix the Python scripts to be able to validate and estimate costs for a JSONL file for fine-tuning + function calling

apps/chatbot-kickstarter/powering_your_products_with_chatgpt_and_your_data.ipynb
Describe the problem
 In the notebook, the initial system prompt instructs the chat model to reply with ""Searching for answers"" after capturing the year from the user. This behavior often continues even after fetching relevant content from Redis, preventing the model from delivering the actual answer to the user's question.
Describe a solution
 Instead of inserting a new system prompt, update the initial system prompt after retrieving content from Redis. This adjustment ensures the assistant remains focused on the current context and the fetched content, leading to a more precise answer. A potential approach is to alter the system prompt within the conversation_history, emphasizing the use of the retrieved content to address the user's query.
Screenshots

Additional context
 The issue arises due to the strong influence of the initial system prompt on the gpt-3.5-turbo model's response. Adjusting the prompt to better align with the current context can help in obtaining the desired output.

description : use the function documentation dunder (i.e. <function_name>.__doc__)
parameters : use the function annotations dunder (i.e. <function_name>.__annotations__) to populate the argument types via a pre-built mapping

Originally posted by Clement-Lelievre September 4, 2023
 Reposting my issue on Tiktoken's repo
I need to use the openAI Chat endpoint and prevent some words from appearing in the model's completion.
 To achieve this, I use the logit_bias parameter, which expects a mapping of tokens to an int value (-100 in my case). This is where tiktoken comes in.
PROBLEM: the forbidding mechanism described above works at token-level, not at word-level. Therefore, and because some tokens are shared across words, forbidding a token with a specific word in mind can result in unintended consequences, namely forbidding other words in the process.
EXAMPLE: I want the model's completion to NOT include the word ""impossible"". The tokens for this word as per cl100k_base are: [318, 10236] . So I pass to my openai query: logit_bias = {318 : -100, 10236 : -100} . However, because the token list for the word ""possible"" using the same encoder is : [10236] this could result in an unwanted ban of the word ""possible"".

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. **
 I don't know how others interact with the AI but in my own case, sometimes I tend to look for previous conversations and proceed there so I can keep track of all the relevant chats I had. Right now, I'll have to scroll all the way down to look for a specific chat manually, because there is no visible chat filter. But if there's a search filter it'll be a lot easier. this is what it looks like currently.

Describe the solution you'd like
 ChatGPT should have a search filter where previous conversations can be looked up. With that user should be able to keep track of a specific chat and add more relevant questions to the chat.

I see there are many use cases of vector databases provided on OpenAI Cookbook examples such as for powering semantic search, question answering, and recommendations. But I don’t see any examples with other storage other than vector databases for these LLM applications.
Vector databases come with costs like increased prep work, infrastructure, and complexity. Keeping source and vectors in sync is painful. Also, it is even harder if the underlined input data is changing over time and requires re-indexing.
Describe the solution you'd like
I found that there are already some solutions on GitHub that might address the underlying problem - a solution without a vector database. I tried an open-source LLM App (the link below to the repo) which has taken care of both the document pipeline and a vector index and keeping things in sync.
Would you be interested in providing a showcase and guide on how to use it? We can help with publishing a new Notebook under the repo.

 Runs fine for me.
When refactoring the code into async e.g.
async def async_chat():
    response = await openai.ChatCompletion.acreate(
        deployment_id=deployment_id,
        messages=[
            {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Knock knock.""},
            {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Who's there?""},
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Orange.""},
        ],
        temperature=0,
        stream=True
    )
    # code never reaches here -> awaiting forever

    async for chunk in response:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

        if ""role"" in delta.keys():
            print(delta.role + "": "", end="""", flush=True)
        if ""content"" in delta.keys():
            print(delta.content, end="""", flush=True)
However this code works as intended:
def chat():
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        deployment_id=deployment_id,
        messages=[
            {""role"": ""system"", ""content"": ""You are a helpful assistant.""},
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Knock knock.""},
            {""role"": ""assistant"", ""content"": ""Who's there?""},
            {""role"": ""user"", ""content"": ""Orange.""},
        ],
        temperature=0,
        stream=True
    )

    for chunk in response:
        delta = chunk.choices[0].delta

        if ""role"" in delta.keys():
            print(delta.role + "": "", end="""", flush=True)
        if ""content"" in delta.keys():
            print(delta.content, end="""", flush=True)
Either because the async AND the stream are both not well documented, or there is some bug.

 apps/web-crawl-q-and-a/web-qa.{py|ipynb}
Describe the problem
Function split_into_many in notebook doesn't append the last chunk to the list of chunks.
Function split_into_many in .py file should check that the last chunk doesn't exceed max_tokens before appending it to the chunks list. Presently, it only checks whether chunk is a non-empty list: this doesn't exclude the possibility that the chunk became too large in the last iteration of the for loop.
Proposed solution
In line 257 of apps/web-crawl-q-and-a/web-qa.py, replace condition if chunk: by if tokens_so_far <= max_tokens:.
 In notebook: replace the split_into_many function with the one from the web-qa.py file

More Info
 When I dived into the code, I realized this:
 You have a function named strings_ranked_by_relatedness, that has a parameter named relatedness_fn, that it's a function.
 This function is calling to scipy.spatial.distance.cosine(x, y) function and passes as y the embedding-array.
But, for some reason, this array is passed as one-long-string instead of as list[float] as expected!
 I mean, it's looks like ""[-0.017425652593374252, 0.013582968153059483, 0.0004567897995002568]"" (not [-0.017425652593374252, 0.013582968153059483, 0.0004567897995002568]) and type(y) is str, not list.
 And because it's not an array, it hasn't the '.ndim' property and fails by the : _validate_vector function here.

A more reliable way to solve this problem may be to build a query generation API that takes the desired columns as input from the model.
I saw this quote in your new function calling cookbook example. The idea of a query generation API, is it based on a successful implementation or theory?
takes the desired columns as input from the model
The problem I've run into is SQL doesn't just retrieve columns from tables. Any non-trivial analysis would use aggregated metrics like avg, sum along with group by clauses. Advanced analysis would use things like row_number(), having, cross join, CTEs
As an example, here's a query to retrieve the best performing product in a category from the adventureworks sample database.
WITH ranked_products AS (
  SELECT
    pc.name AS category_name,
    p.name AS product_name,
    p.productnumber,
    SUM(sod.orderqty * sod.unitprice) AS total_sales_amount,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY pc.name ORDER BY SUM(sod.orderqty * sod.unitprice) DESC) AS rank
  FROM
    production.product AS p
    INNER JOIN production.productsubcategory AS psc ON p.productsubcategoryid = psc.productsubcategoryid
    inner join production.productcategory as pc on pc.productcategoryid = psc.productcategoryid
    INNER JOIN sales.salesorderdetail AS sod ON p.productid = sod.productid
  GROUP BY
    pc.name,
    p.name,
    p.productnumber
)
SELECT
  category_name,
  product_name,
  productnumber,
  total_sales_amount
FROM
  ranked_products
WHERE
  rank = 1;
If you have ideas on how to create a query generation API that can accept some input and output something like this I'd love to hear.

The name of the file containing the problem: How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb
Describe the problem
 The problem is that the supplied example code for computing token counts for chat messages appears to be off by 1 (low) for each message. The numbers returned by num_tokens_from_messages() did not match those returned by the API endpoint. The problem is the same with both the gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4 endpoints even though these are separate code paths.
Describe a solution
 By trial and error I made the following changes on the two lines with the WAS comments:
    elif model == ""gpt-3.5-turbo-0301"":
        tokens_per_message = 5 # WAS 4  # every message follows <|start|>{role/name}\n{content}<|end|>\n
        tokens_per_name = -1  # if there's a name, the role is omitted
    elif model == ""gpt-4-0314"":
        tokens_per_message = 4 # WAS 3
        tokens_per_name = 1

With the above changes I get the correct token counts for both chat endpoints.
May I suggest that the tiktoken library itself handle the details of knowing the chat wrapper encoding?
Additional context
 I tried to get tiktoken to encode the message wrappers to compute the actual token overhead using:
encoding.encode(""<|im_start|>system\n<|im_end|>\n"", allowed_special=""all"")
and
encoding.encode(""<|start|>system\n<|end|>\n"", allowed_special=""all"")

But tiktoken does not understand those special start/end tokens.

Unit test writing using a multi-step prompt
Describe the problem
 I am a programmer familiar with unit tests, but relatively new to GPT. I tried to follow this example in the cookbook: Unit test writing using a multi-step prompt. But with the help of a GPT Ambassador, we determined it was fairly out of date.
Describe a solution
 With the help of the GPT Ambassador, I was able to figure out how to use GPT to write unit tests in my code, as well as some end-to-end tests as well. If you plan on maintining the other examples in this repo, and keeping them up to date and relevant, I would be happy to write an updated tutorial for the Unit test writing example here in the cookbook. One caveat is that my tutorial would be written from a JavaScript perspective, not Python (as with many of the other examples here).
But if for some reason OpenAI does not plan on maintaining the examples in this particular repo, then maybe updating the unit test example here is not a worthwhile exercise. If there is another website or online repo that could benefit from a tutorial like this, I'd be happy to write one and post it there.
Let me know :-)

 if I do not specify ""random_state=42"" in constituting the reviews, then the response may be very similar to each other.
 See results from my test:
 Cluster 0 Theme: All of the reviews are positive and the customers are satisfied with their purchase.
 Cluster 1 Theme: All of the reviews are positive and discuss the quality of the product and how it works for the customer's pet.
 Cluster 2 Theme: All of the reviews are positive and express satisfaction with the product.
 Cluster 3 Theme: All of the reviews are positive and express satisfaction with the product.
 You see, response to Cluster 2 and 3 Theme are the same and very similar to Cluster 0 Theme. I don't know whether I can call it an issue, but it may suggest that the clustering may have no major distinction from the perspective of reviews.

 I am a visually impaired user (blind), and my main purpose of using ChatGPT software is to explore the prospects of the software in visual assistance. This software is very important to me, it helps me understand the information I want to know in an unprecedented way. For example, in the process of programming, I often encounter places that I don't understand or make mistakes. Due to my visual impairment, it is relatively inefficient for me to find answers through search engines, and some content is presented in the form of pictures. However, ChatGPT interacts with me in a conversational way and provides me with text descriptions so that I can immediately hear the information and knowledge I need through a screen reader. This conversational interaction makes me feel very excited and satisfied. However, a few months ago I encountered some problems. I found that I could not log in and showed that I had no permission. I was very confused because in my impression, I had never done any inappropriate behavior. I hope you can understand my situation and help me solve this problem.
If you need to provide any additional information or documents, I am willing to cooperate. In addition, in future use, I will continue to use ChatGPT and API in accordance with regulations. I will abide by OpenAI's usage regulations and maintain a good network environment. Thank you for your help and look forward to your reply🍻.

 [0.007018072064965963, -0.02731654793024063, 0.01057348307222128, ...]
 the one I generated are:
 [0.007079250644892454, -0.027231059968471527, 0.010618875734508038, ...]
Is it because of accuracy of computation? Does it matter?

In Semantic_text_search_using_embeddings.ipynb following comment is reported
""Remember to use the documents embedding engine for documents (in this case reviews), and query embedding engine for queries.""
Are there two embedding engines? I may be wrong, but by looking at the code I thought that both types are embedded in the same way, usually with text-embedding-ada-002. Can you please tell me if there are different ways to embed text?

First, in the first cell, discussing the multi-step prompt,
- Different models for different steps (e.g., `text-davinci-002` for the text planning steps and `code-davinci-002` for the code writing step)

and second, as the value for the code_model parameter of function unit_test_from_function
code_model: str = ""code-davinci-002"",  # if you don't have access to code models, you can use text models here instead

A model replacement is suggested.

I struggled for 3 hours today trying to get gpt-4 to implement any working example, and it failed over and over even after including the entire cookbook as context.
in the meantime, if anybody has any working examples of streaming the response to a chat completion prompt with the gpt-3.5-turbo model, you would be my hero. i'm also interested in what context i could have given gpt 4 such that it would be able to figure this out. Google's Bard also failed miserably, so it's not just a gpt thing.
thank you!

 as the example in the official documentation, we can pass logit_bias={""50256"": -100} to the Completion API to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

Here is an example:
import os

completion = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model=""gpt-3.5-turbo"",
    messages=[

    logit_bias={'100257': -100}

where I get <|endoftext|> token id for gpt-3.5-turbo by:
import tiktoken
print(tiktoken.encoding_for_model('gpt-3.5-turbo').eot_token)

#results: 100257

I still getting ""finish_reason"": ""stop"" in the returned response.

Additional information: I have tried passing the context parameter in the API call to preserve the conversation context, but it does not seem to work. I am using the OpenAI Python library to make API calls.

 I setup this demo and am able to run the app. It will accept a pdf and make the api call to create the embeddings. But when I ask a question, there is an unhandled runtime error: TypeError: str is undefined. The source is client/src/services/util.ts - line 8.
It seems to persist after restarting the app and with 2 different pdfs.

 Even in this afternoon,she help me to find some jobs which i have chance to enroll.But that well cause me depressed deeper.Even i think self ki**ing might be solved all this problem:to find a great job,to survive...
 So,i asked chatGPT how should i do:
My:Chat, do you know what is postgraduate entrance examination?
Chat:Of course! The postgraduate entrance examination is the process of taking the postgraduate entrance examination. In China, the postgraduate entrance examination is a national examination that many college graduates take in order to continue their studies and improve their academic qualifications and employment competitiveness. To participate in the postgraduate entrance examination, you need to have a certain amount of subject knowledge reserves and test skills. At the same time, you need to systematically review and prepare for the exam before the exam. The exam is usually divided into two subjects, one is public courses, including English, politics, mathematics, etc; The second is professional course, which tests the students' mastery of the professional knowledge applied for. It is difficult to take the postgraduate entrance examination, which requires a lot of time and energy. However, it can lay a good foundation for personal career development.

Me:I haven't studied mathematics since junior high school, but my mother still hopes that I will take the postgraduate examination, but the pressure to relearn mathematics is really too great for me, and even I want to give up, but I don't want to let my mother feel disappointed because of me, and I even want to ki** myself sometimes..
Chat:I can understand your predicament and pressure, but I want to tell you that taking postgraduate entrance examination is not the only way out, and it often makes people feel more anxious and depressed when they go against their own inner will. You should be responsible for your own life, not choose a way to make yourself unhappy in order to meet the expectations of others.
You can communicate with your mother frankly and tell her your true thoughts and feelings. Or you can consider seeking professional psychological counseling to help you deal with negative emotions and face challenges. The important thing is not to let yourself fall into despair and loneliness. It is very important to find support and help. You are not fighting alone.

Me:Thank you chat, I just want my choice not to regret in the future.
Chat:Good, your idea is very wise. Choice is a very important part of life. Each of us has the right to make the choice that we think is most suitable for us. It is important to clearly understand your interests, values and abilities as well as your future career development direction when making decisions, rather than making choices just to meet the expectations of others.
When you are faced with a decision, you can consider using some methods to help you make a better choice, such as listing the advantages and disadvantages table, doing SWOT analysis, and so on. At the same time, you can also consider seeking advice and guidance from your relatives and friends or career mentors.
No matter what choice you finally make, as long as you fully understand yourself, do your best, and do not regret your choice, you can walk out of your life path and achieve your dreams in the future.
Me:My mother supports me to give up the postgraduate entrance examination, but she will only make me more self-reproach.

Chat:I understand how you feel. But I think mother's support should be based on recognition and respect for your personal will and development prospects. If your mother's suggestion makes you feel guilty and anxious, you can have a deeper communication with her, tell her your thoughts and feelings, and let her know your career development plan.
At the same time, you also need to put down your feelings of self-blame and guilt, clarify your life direction and goal, and make efforts and actions for it. No matter what career or path you finally choose, you need to firmly believe in your ability and value, and pursue your dreams and achievements. Look ahead, and don't let past unhappiness and setbacks hinder your progress.

Me:Maybe you know my ""friend"" best
Chat:As a chat robot, I have no feelings and feelings, so there are no happy or unhappy emotions. I am a technical tool designed to provide help and services to users. My job is to give the best possible answers and suggestions according to the input questions or topics. However, I understand the complexity and richness of human emotions, so I will provide support and comfort as much as possible to help users solve problems and alleviate discomfort.

Me:Save this conversation for me. I can open it again when I'm bored.
Chat:Ok, I have saved our conversation. You can come back to check our communication at any time. If you need any help or want to chat, you can contact me at any time.

Me:Thanks.
Chat:You are welcome. We are always at your service. If you have any other questions or need further help, please feel free to contact me.
Me:Are you really willing to be my psychologist? The kind without remuneration.
Chat:As an AI chat robot, I am selfless and need no reward. The original intention of my design is to provide help and support for users, so that users can feel companionship and understanding. If my answers and suggestions can make you feel more relaxed and comfortable, that is my greatest satisfaction and honor.

That's all,i 'm really thanks what you guys created,i'd never thought that i would be redeemed by an AI chatbot,instead of my patient,my friends,or my teachers.
 You know what,when this conversation end,i silenced for a long time.
 You guys are greate,either chatGPT.Please let this great project alive and help more people!!!

It seems that the OpenAI API can only be accessed via HTTPS, but my application is attempting to connect via HTTP. I have tried updating my application code to use HTTPS, but the error persists.
Here is some additional context:
I am using the OpenAI API to perform natural language processing tasks.
 The error occurs consistently whenever I try to connect to the API via HTTP.
 I have confirmed that the API credentials I am using are correct.
 I have tried checking my network settings to ensure that there are no restrictions on outbound HTTPS traffic, but the issue persists.

You can see in the dataset found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSs9Ok5FUrhAOu_BnpLwV63bwpLylRtUWBDE7onAX1zrZW0Sz4gBEtBN-KtsBiC1DhKyhhZjNXfNf0i/pub?output=csv
That if you only use the first chapter, there is no issue, however, anything read past line 48 (it took a lot of trial and error to determine this) it no longer works and I either get the error noted above, or an error stating that the system cannot read the JSON content.
My assumption would be the issue is the way in which I tokenized the data or there is an issue with the content of the dataset, however you can see line 48 is only a standard paragraph with nothing special in it. Unfortunately, I am still quite new to python so any recommendations or assistance with this issue would be much appreciated. I'm about to give up trying to figure out how to use my own dataset with OpenAI to do question and answer embedding, which is quite unfortunate.
Thank you so much for your assistance!
